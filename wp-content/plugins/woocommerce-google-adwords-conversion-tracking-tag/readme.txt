 * [Meta (Facebook)](https://sweetcode.com/docs/wpm/plugin-configuration/meta)

6. And read through our [FAQ](https://sweetcode.com/docs/wpm/faq).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there detailed documentation for the plugin? =

Yes. Head over to this link: [Documentation](https://sweetcode.com/docs/wpm/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=wpm-plugin-page&utm_campaign=pixel-manager-for-woocommerce-docs)

= How do I check if the plugin is working properly? =

1. Turn off any kind of caching and / or minification plugins.
2. Log out of the shop.
3. Turn off any kind of ad or script blocker in your browser.
4. Search for one of your keywords and click on one of your ads.
5. Purchase an item from your shop.
6. Wait up to 48 hours until the conversion shows up in Google Ads. (usually takes only a few hours)

With the Google Tag Assistant you will also be able to see the tag fired on the thankyou page.

= HPOS (High Performance Orders Storage) =

The Pixel Manager is ready for the new WooCommerce [High Performance Orders Storage (HPOS)](https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/09/14/high-performance-order-storage-progress-report/) feature.

= Plugin compatibility =

Our plugin is designed to work seamlessly with 99.99% of all other plugins. In the rare event of a conflict with a third-party plugin, we typically identify a fix or workaround quickly.

To illustrate its broad compatibility, here are a few examples of third-party plugins that work well with the Pixel Manager:

* Async Javascript
* Automptimize
* CartFlows
* Cloudflare Plugin
* Cost of Goods for WooCommerce (WPFactory)
* Doofinder for WooCommerce
* FlyingPress
* Hummingbird
* Litespeed Cache
* Litespeed ESI
* NitroPack
* Siteground Optimizer
* W3 Total Cache
* WooCommerce Brands
* WooCommerce Composite Products
* WooCommerce Cost of Goods (SkyVerge)
* WooCommerce Deposits
* WooCommerce Google Product Feed
* WooCommerce Subscriptions
* WooCommerce Wishlists
* Woo Discount Rules
* WP Fastest Cache
* WP Marketing Robot Feed Manager
* WP Optimize
* WP Rocket
* WP Super Cache
* YITH WooCommerce Brands
* YITH WooCommerce Wishlist

Rest assured, this is just a small sample, and the Pixel Manager should integrate smoothly with almost all other plugins you may use.

= Will the Pixel Manager slow down my site? =

No. The plugin is very lightweight and fast.

* The back-end features are small and efficient.
* Database queries are designed to be fast and are cached where possible.
* Larger tasks are executed during nighttime using the Action Scheduler.
* The front-end JavaScript library is compiled, minified and pre-compressed with gzip and brotli.
* The pro version even allows lazy loading of the JavaScript library.

= Do you have videos that show how to set up the plugin and get most out of it? =

Yes, they are part of the step by step documentation. Head over to this link: [Documentation](https://sweetcode.com/docs/wpm/)

= I get a fatal error and I am running old versions of WordPress and/or WooCommerce. What can I do? =

As this is a free plugin we don't support old versions of WordPress and WooCommerce. You will have to update your installation.

= I am using an offsite payment gateway and the conversions are not being tracked. What can I do? =

We don't support if an offsite payment gateway is in use. The reason is that those cases can be complex and time consuming to solve. We don't want to cover this for a free plugin. We do not recommend offsite payment gateways anyway. A visitor can stop the redirection manually which prevents at least some conversions to be tracked. Also offsite payment gateways are generally bad for the conversion rate.

= I've done everything right in the test, but it still doesn't work. What can I do? =

Here is a non-exhaustive list of causes that might interfere with the plugin code.

* Minification plugins try to minify the JavaScript code of the plugin. Not all minification plugins do this good enough and can cause problems. Turn off the JavaScript minification and try again.
* Caching could also cause problems if caching is set too aggressively. Generally don't ever enable HTML caching on a WooCommerce shop, as it can cause troubles with plugins that generate dynamic output.

= I see issues in the backend of my shop. Admin pages get rendered weird, and popups don't go away when I click to close them. How can I fix this? =

You probably have some script or ad blocker activated. Deactivate it and the issues should go away. Usually you can disable the blocker for just that particular site (your WooCommerce back end).

Our plugin injects tracking pixels on the front end of WooCommerce shops. As a consequence scripts of our plugin have been added to some privacy filter lists. The idea is to prevent the scripts running if a shop visitor has some ad blocker enabled and wants to visit the front end of the shop. This is totally ok for visitors of the front end of the shop. But, it becomes an issue for admins of the shop who have a blocker activated in their browser and visit the backend of the shop.

Unfortunately, there is no way for us to generally approve our scripts in all blockers for the WooCommerce back end.

Therefore, we recommend admins of the shop to exclude their own shop from the blocker in their browser.

= Where can I report a bug or suggest improvements? =

Please post your problem in the Pixel Manager for WooCommerce Support forum: [Link](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-google-adwords-conversion-tracking-tag)
You can send the link to the front page of your shop too if you think it would be of help.

= I found a security vulnerability. How do I report it? =

We are committed to ensuring the security of our customers and their data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Pixel Manager for WooCommerce, we encourage you to report it through Patchstack our security partner. Patchstack runs a managed Vulnerability Disclosure Program (mVDP) that helps us receive, triage, and respond to reported vulnerabilities.
