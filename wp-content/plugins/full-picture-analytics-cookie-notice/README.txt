## ALTERNATIVE TO...

WP Full Picture is an alternative to:
- PixelYourSite, Pixel Manager for WooCommerce and other similar plugins,
- GTM4WP plugin (WP FP includes its own Google Tag Manager integration),
- CookieBot, CookieYes, Complianz and similar solutions

## 😊 WHO IS IT FOR

WP Full Picture is for everyone with minimal knowledge of analytics tools, however, you need to know HTML and CSS to use advanced functions.

We do not recommend WP Full Picture, if you show ads on your website. Our consent banner does not have the IAB certificate for websites with ads.

## 👌 WHY CHOOSE WP FULL PICTURE?

Choose WP Full Picture if you want to:

- manage all your analytics tools and privacy solutions with one plugin,
- follow GDPR, PiPEDA and other privacy laws,
- quickly set up advanced tracking of user actions and WooCommerce events,
- avoid conflicts between analytics tools and consent banners,
- display analytics dashboards from Looker Studio, Databox, or other similar platforms inside WP admin.

## ✍️ PREMIUM SERVICES - RECORDS OF CONSENT

Many consent management solutions keep basic record of consents in the WordPress's database.

However, these consents often cannot prove that the visitor had enough information to make a choice. What is more, consents in the site's database can be easily manipulated.

Unlike them, WP Full Picture's consents are saved in the cloud server in France (where you cannot edit them) and also contain:
- configuration of consent banner at the time of consent
- configuration of analytics tools at the time of consent
- copy of privacy policy page
- and more

[See example](https://wpfullpicture.com/sdc_download/20763/?key=uttr6mmij3ssnrpyeo3myg4ys7i0y1).

## 💎 WP FULL PICTURE PRO

WP Full Picture Pro is a powerful tool for businesses. It offers:

- **CAPI / Server-side tracking** - more accurate tracking in Meta Pixel and Google Analytics (for WooCommerce orders).
- **Status-based order tracking** - tracking purchases when they get specific order status.
- **Advanced Triggers** - this lets you track multi-step actions, like visiting 5 product pages or showing interest in a product.
- **Lead scoring** - scores visitors based on their actions to see which traffic sources bring the best leads.
- **Metadata tracking** - tracking custom user, post and taxonomy data.
- and more

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there anything I should know before I start using the plugin? =

Yes. If you use a caching plugin or a tool like Autoptimize, make sure to turn off the settings that combine and minifiy JavaScript files. These can cause issues with the plugin.

= Is WP Full Picture incompatible with any plugins or themes? =

Yes. So far we have noticed that the plugin has problems with:

- PixelYourSite plugin - to avoid issues, please go to General Settings page > Performance section > and enable option "Save main JS functions in a file"
- OceanWP theme - Consent Banner settings do not show in the Theme Customizer
- Kubio theme - the theme uses CSS styles that makes WP FP's Consent Banner show in the center of the page instead of the screen. To fix it, please add to your website this custom CSS `body#kubio{transform: none !important;}`
- Vertice theme - the same problem and solution as above

= Is WP Full Picture compatible with page builders? =

Yes. We tested it with Elementor, Bricks, Breakdance and saw no issues.

= Does WP Full Picture support Google's consent mode v2? =

Yes. Consent mode v2 is fully supported. It works with Google Analytics, Google Ads and GTM. You can enable it in the settings of the cookie notice / consent banner.

= Does WP Full Picture display statistics in the dashboard? =

Yes. WP Full Picture lets you display in your WP admin panel reports and dashboards created in Google Looker Studio, Databox and other similar services. 

These platforms allow you to create advanced reports with aggregated data from various analytics and marketing tools, Google spreadsheets and even WooCommerce data.

= I installed an analytics tool using a different plugin. Do I have to remvoe it and install again using WP Full Picture? =

No. Use Tracking Tools Manager module to take control of tracking scripts loaded by other plugins.

= Do I have to use the WP Full Picture's cookie notice? =

No you don't. All the modules can be used separately.

= Can I use a different consent management plugin or platform (CookieBot, Iubenda, CookieYes, etc.) with WP Full Picture? =

No. WP Full Picture's modules for installing analytics tools are optimized to work with WP Full Picture's consent banner.

= Can I use WP Full Picture on a website that displays ads? =

yes, but with limitations. To show personalised ads from Google Adsense and other similar advertising platforms, you need to use a consent banner with IAB FTC certificate. WP Full Picture does not have it at the moment.

= How does WP Full Picture's cookie notice block cookies?

WP Full Picture doesn't need to block cookies. Instead, it blocks scripts that install and use these cookies.

The end result is the same, but the website works a little bit faster because it loads the tracking scripts only after the visitor agrees to cookies.

= Is WP Full Picture's cookie notice limited in any way? =

No. It can be displayed unlimited number of times, on unlimited pages by unlimited number of visitors.

= I live in the EU, but I want to start tracking visitors right after they visit the page. Can I do this? =

Technically, you can. Legally you can't.

= Will my site comply with ALL privacy regulations just by using WP Full Picture? =

No. Privacy regulations cover many areas of business. WP Full Picture helps you handle only a part of it, so you still need to be aware and act accordingly to be fully compliant with the rest of them.

= Can I translate texts in the cookie notice? =

Yes. WP Full Picture has been tested and works with multilingual plugins WPML and Polylang. It is possible that it also works with other plugins but we haven't tested them.

= Does WP Full Picture generate product feeds for Google Shopping or Facebook? =

No. WP Full Picture is focused on tracking and privacy. To generate a product catalogue you can use one of many plugins from WordPress repository or cloud platforms.
