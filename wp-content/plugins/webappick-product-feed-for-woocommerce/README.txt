== WHY SHOULD YOU USE THIS WOOCOMMERCE PRODUCT FEED PLUGIN? ==

CTX Feed is the best WooCommerce product feed plugin, and we proclaim it because we are the first pioneering plugin builder for creating a Product Feed for WooCommerce. We have been in the industry long enough to understand how WooCommerce feed works. That’s why we have introduced all the WordPress-Goers with our robust and revolutionary features that could facilitate your product uploading experience and get you rid of any trouble you face, such as uploading rejection or lack of necessary marketing channels’ attributes or inability to translate into a correct language or currency, etc.

Over the years of experience and expertise, we have curated all the factors that most online vendors face while creating the feed. You may not customize the product’s description or title properly. Also, the image links for the multiple variations of the same products may not function properly. Besides, making the feed in CSV format requires you to enter the data in the spreadsheet, resulting in a massive energy drain. The immediate transitions do not happen concurrently if you need to create two feed files using CSV and XML format.

Let’s jump deeper into the ample features this mighty plugin has to offer:

= ☞ UNLIMITED PRODUCTS =

No matter the size of your inventory, you can upload all of your products without restrictions. From hundreds to thousands, you can upload unlimited products of your online store into any of the channels mentioned above, and that too with subtlety.

= ☞ UNLIMITED FEED =

Like unlimited product uploading, you can make an infinite number of feeds containing any number of products from any sized store. You can access all the product feed files from the Manage Feeds option. To find the right feed out of a massive collection of feeds, you can look at the unique name of the feed instead of the URL for your convenience.

= 💯100+ PRE-CONFIGURED TEMPLATES 💯 =

With our pre-configured 100+ built-in templates, you can make product feed within minutes without taking excess pressure in researching every attribute or necessary field requirement of the known channels. It is time-consuming and bothersome to some extent. Besides, it is no guarantee that your gleaned attributes will match precisely with the channels’ requirements, as some might change or some might turn from optional to compulsory.

Therefore, it is worth playing it safe to use our ready-made templates crafted extensively for the desired marketplaces.

= ☞ SUPPORTS ANY PRODUCT FEED FILE TYPE =

This stellar WooCommerce product feed manager creates the Product Feed for WooCommerce into five different feed file formats, the highest compared to any WooCommerce feed generator out there. The types are;

* **XML** Product Feed
* **CSV** Product Feed
* **TSV** Product Feed
* **XLS** Product Feed
* **TXT** Product Feed
* **JSON** Product Feed

= ☞ SUPPORTS ANY WOOCOMMERCE PRODUCT TYPES =

We value your concern, and to reduce any unnecessary nuisances of finding the relevant products, CTX Feed enables your WooCommerce feed to fully incorporate by supporting all the plugins that help you provide options for Bundle products, composite products, mix and match products, and finally, subscription product.

= ☞ CATEGORY MAPPING: =

Categories are the essential key to getting products into search results. It is best practice to assign the most matching shopping engine category for each product to your WooCommerce store category. While creating your WooCommerce product feeds, you can also create a category for that particular product. After creating the category, you’ll get an option to map it to your marketplace category to make two categories aligned with each other. This feature is mainly used for Google Shopping and Facebook/Instagram product feeds. The process is dynamic by our plugin & you can map all of your categories to make them more relevant & reachable to buyers.

= ☞ AUTO FEED UPDATE: =

This WooCommerce product feed plugin automatically updates your products based on your given interval time, saving you from manually updating it by logging in and checking. The free version gives you five intervals, whereas the Product Feed Pro for WooCommerce gives you three shorter intervals for quicker feed updates.

= ☞ GOOGLE PRODUCT FEED: =

Creating a product feed for Google Shopping has become twice as easy as ever before. Out of 100+ pre-configured templates, the Google Shopping Product Feed template is one of the most tangible templates, rolling out all the essential attributes that you need to complete the feed creation with the help of this CTX Feed plugin.

In fact, CTX Feed automatically recognizes the value that needs to be set for those required fields for the Google Shopping Product feed. This is the best WooCommerce Google Shopping plugin to create a product feed that abides by the <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112?hl=en">Google product feed specification</a>.

== ☞ FACEBOOK CATALOG  FEED/ INSTAGRAM SHOPPING FEED: ==

Like the WooCommerce product feed for Google Shopping, Facebook, and Instagram have their unique product attributes based on their guidelines. They will differ from the other reputable marketing channels. By using their required attributes, you can facilitate the WooCommerce Facebook product feed catalog, which, in turn, will increase the visibility of your Facebook shop for WooCommerce. The more optimized your WooCommerce Facebook Product Feed Catalog is, the more your products match the relevant keywords searched by the customers. The same applies to the Instagram shop WooCommerce plugin.

Yet this CTX Feed Pro – WooCommerce Product Feed Pro Plugin helps you create the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2144286692311411?id=725943027795860">Facebook country/language override feed</a>for any language you configured in your site.

</blockquote>


== ☞ PRODUCT BRAND (PRO FEATURE) ==

When you focus on your products’ branding, people find it more beneficial as they develop more trust in your online store. When people search for a product, the first thing they will notice is the brand they are purchasing. The brand items, such as their name, logo, and copyright, will retain the customers on your product page longer. Therefore, the ability to have the attribute options to include the brand of the product is a must. CTX Feed has the brand option to let you create the brand of your products and use them in your WooCommerce Product Feed Pro plugin.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://codecanyon.net/item/ultimate-woocommerce-brands-plugin/9433984">Ultimate WooCommerce Brands Plugin</a>

= 💎DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTE (PRO FEATURE) 💎 =

If there is one of the reasons why CTX Feed is the best WooCommerce product data feed plugin, Dynamic attribute complements it. With this pro feature, you can set a series of conditions on each attribute regardless of any marketing channels. These conditions ensure that the products will meet the conditions based on their selected attributes, and based on that, they or their relevant information will appear. For example, if you want certain products’ height > 2cm ‘to appear as “big” and the rest of them with height < 2cm to be “small,” it can be done by dynamic attribute feature. This will help you to meet any channel requirements.

= 💎SMART FILTER & CONDITION (PRO FEATURE) 💎 =

Smart & Advanced features are two of the most remarkable features of CTX Feed Pro. Both features can include or remove the products based on your instructions. Suppose you want specific products, such as products with backorder, out-of-stock, or empty description products, to be out of the Product Feed for WooCommerce. In that case, you can quickly tick them within this plugin Product Feed Pro for WooCommerce in the Smart Filtering option. You can also include products that are either loss-making or in lower demand.

Besides, Advanced Filtering allows you to apply certain conditions to products based on their various attributes, such as title, ID, description, height, length, weight, price, price with tax, availability, etc. Depending on the conditions, the product feed will either include all the conditions or only any fulfilled conditions.

= 💎ATTRIBUTE MAPPING (PRO FEATURE) 💎 =

First impressions are the most lasting. The title is the one that customers fancy first. In most cases, the e-commerce owners hardly prioritize the title, but this is where your competitors are more likely to take advantage of it. Good titles will encourage you to click on that product and switch straight to that product’s leading online site. The customers get an in-depth insight into what that product is all about. If the title is short or too ambiguous, it will increase the bounce rate, leading the customers to refrain from it. Therefore, CTX Feed Pro has a built-in attribute mapping feature that lets you extend the title or any attributes to force the customers to click and yet purchase your products.

= 💥MULTI-LANGUAGE FEED – WPML & POLYLANG (PRO FEATURE) 💥 =

WooCommerce Product Feed Pro is a plugin for Multi-Language Feed. Supporting WPML and Polylang makes it possible for WooCommerce store owners to create WooCommerce product feeds in different languages and currencies.

= 💥MULTI-CURRENCY FEED (PRO FEATURE) 💥 =

WooCommerce Product Feed Pro can create product feeds for specific currencies.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://wclovers.com/">WCFM Marketplace for WooCommerce</a>.

= 💥CUSTOM ATTRIBUTE (PRO FEATURE) 💥 =

If you have added any custom attribute field to your product, you will get the product attribute list fields while creating a feed to assign your product's custom field value to your channel attribute.

= 💥CUSTOM  FIELDS – ACF, FIELD FACTORY, ETC. (PRO FEATURE) 💥 =

This plugin supports the <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/">Advanced Custom Field (ACF)</a> or any custom field plugin’s fields as attribute values. You can assign your custom product attribute values to any feed attribute.

= 💥PRODUCT META & TAXONOMIES (PRO FEATURE) 💥 =

Product taxonomies are more like attributes’ categories. Brands, sizes, and weights have their own value, which is considered the attributes’ value when applied to the feed. Using this WooCommerce product feed pro plugin, any product meta or taxonomy created by any plugin can be added to the feed.
