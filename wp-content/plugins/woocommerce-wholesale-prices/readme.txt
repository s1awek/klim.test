**WHOLESALE WOOCOMMERCE PRICING EXTENSION – FREE, SIMPLE & ACCURATE**

No complex setups and no confusing WooCommerce dynamic pricing or WooCommerce discount rules to figure out. It's simply plug and play. 

Providing WooCommerce bulk discounts has never been easier for wholesale WooCommerce customer types (it adds a new user role for "Wholesale Customer").

Wholesale Suite lets you add new wholesale WooCommerce user roles to create additional role levels for your customers. This allows you to show multiple prices per product based on the user role.

After installing the plugin, you'll have a new user role called "Wholesale Customer". This acts exactly like the "Customers" user role that WooCommerce adds but lets you distinguish your wholesale customers.

In your Product Edit screen you'll find a new wholesale pricing box. This lets you enter wholesale prices for the Wholesale Customer user role, effectively giving them a wholesale discount based on their user role for the product.

To activate wholesale capabilities for your customers simply change their WordPress user account to the new wholesale user role and they will receive the wholesale pricing when they login. It's very simple and the plugin takes care of the rest!

If you want multiple WooCommerce user roles you can add an unlimited number of additional user roles with the [WooCommerce Wholesale Prices Premium add-on](https://wholesalesuiteplugin.com/woocommerce-wholesale-prices-premium/).

**WOOCOMMERCE DYNAMIC PRICING FOR WHOLESALE DISCOUNT RULES**

You might not always have a WooCommerce bulk discount for each product, so you don't have to set wholesale pricing for all of your products, you can just do a sub-set.

Similar extensions like WooCommerce dynamic prices extensions are NOT made specifically for wholesale or B2B purposes so they aren't aware of the challenges of WooCommerce b2b sales and they don't take into account the special needs of wholesale customers. This often leaves store owners feeling frustrated trying to figure out how all those WooCommerce discount rules hang together.

We have purposefully created Wholesale Suite as a flexible solution specifically for wholesale sales. It's the perfect solution to WooCommerce tiered pricing using WordPress's robust user role system.

This free version lets you set prices on Simple products & product variations easily for one wholesale user role and is a great way to get started selling to wholesale customers online.

**WORDPRESS WHOLESALE USER ROLES**

Display of your wholesale prices is automatic once your wholesale customers login to their account. The plugin takes care of the front end display. It's like giving a WooCommerce private store just for that customer.

The store admin just needs the add the new user role "Wholesale Customer" to the customer's user account and they will see the wholesale pricing that you have set on your products.

You can add multiple wholesale user role levels with the [WooCommerce Wholesale Prices Premium add-on](https://wholesalesuiteplugin.com/woocommerce-wholesale-prices-premium/).

You can also recruit new wholesale customers automatically with a custom WooCommerce user registration for your wholesale customers using the [Wholesale Lead Capture plugin](https://wholesalesuiteplugin.com/woocommerce-wholesale-lead-capture/).

**WOOCOMMERCE CATALOG MODE (PRIVATE STORE)**

Want to set up a WooCommerce private store in catalog mode? You can now do it easily with the free wholesale plugin option to hide add to cart and retail pricing.

Turn any store into a catalog only WooCommerce private store by simply enabling the option. Once done, only logged in wholesale users will be able to see pricing on your store.

This makes it easy to run a separate wholesale store if you want, or simply to create an online presence even if you only have a B2B wholesale business and not a retail business.

Wholesale Suite is the most compatible wholesale WooCommerce plugin, hands down. We have worked with loads of other developers in the community to ensure that your wholesale features can work with all your website's features.
