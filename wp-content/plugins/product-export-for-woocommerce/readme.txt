= Select Your WooCommerce Product Export Columns =

As the video demonstrates, you can use our Drag & Drop tool to quickly select your product export columns. You can rearrange these columns, rename them, and even combine them. If you need an entirely custom product field, you can build it using our embedded PHP functions.

In other words, you can build a product export that meets your exact layout requirements, whatever they may be.

= Create Flexible Product Export Filters =

Sometimes, you need to export only a subset of your products. For example, you may want to export only active products.

You can do this easily with WP All Export. You can build filters using any combination of product fields, including those created by 3rd-party plugins or add-ons.

You can build simple filters, combination filters, or nest your filter conditions (equivalent to using parentheses).

If filtering against date fields, you can even use relative date filter conditions like “last week” or “last month”.

There is no need to compromise here. You can filter your product export in whatever way you want.

= Export Products to CSV, Excel, and XML =

By default, our plugin exports products to a CSV file format.

But you can just as easily export products to Excel using either the .xls or .xlsx formats.

If you prefer XML, you can build everything from the simplest to the most complex XML feed imaginable.

= Export Products to the Google Merchant Center =

The Google Merchant Center (GMC) is a platform that lets you share your product information across Google, which makes it easier for customers to find your products and your store.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that GMC has extensive data requirements that can take many hours to satisfy.

To address this, we’ve built a product export template that helps you comply with Google’s requirements. Just choose the Google Merchant Center Product Feed as your export type, fill out the onscreen forms, and you’ll be able to upload your products in a matter of minutes.

Even better, if Google modifies its requirements in any way, we immediately update our plugin to match, meaning you can just re-run your product export to fulfill the new requirements.

= Bulk Edit Your WooCommerce Product Data =

Bulk editing WooCommerce products is a common task. Sometimes, you need to alter many product prices or modify product descriptions as part of a sales promotion.

Whatever your reason, we make bulk editing products painless. Just export your products, edit them in a spreadsheet using features like search-and-replace, copy-and-paste, etc., then import everything back into WooCommerce using WP All Import.

What makes this so painless is that WP All Import is aware of the export settings, which allows it to automatically configure the import process. No muss, no fuss, just a quick, highly efficient editing process.

= Migrate Your WooCommerce Products From One Store to Another =

Need to copy your WooCommerce products from one store to another?

No problem. When you export products from the source site, just download our special bundle file. This file contains import instructions in addition to your product export data.

Import this bundle file on your destination site, and WP All Import will automatically configure itself. It really couldn’t be any easier.

= Run Your Product Export on a Schedule =

A product export can play a vital role in synchronizing data with other stores or marketing platforms. These updates generally occur on a regular basis.

To support this, we allow you to schedule your product export. You can do this using cron jobs on your server, or, if you sign up for our automatic scheduling service, you can do it directly through our plugin’s interface.

Either way, you can set up your product export just once and then forget about it.

= Integrate Your Product Export with External Applications =

Zapier is a leading integration platform. It allows you to connect triggers, such as the completion of a product export, to actions. These actions can include uploading an export file to one of many file host platforms, generating an email with the export file as an attachment, etc.

Our plugin is designed to work with Zapier, meaning that you can connect your product export to any of 1000s of external applications. Talk about extensibility!
